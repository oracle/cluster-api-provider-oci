                                          For example, if egress traffic allows TCP
                                          destination port 80, there should be an
                                          ingress rule to allow TCP source port 80.

                                          you need to support bidirectional traffic.
                                          For example, if ingress traffic allows TCP
                                          destination port 80, there should be an
                                          egress rule to allow TCP source port 80.
                                          Defaults to false, which means the rule
                                          is stateful and a corresponding rule is
                                          not necessary for bidirectional traffic.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources
                        like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful
                        (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is
                        important.
