Kubernetes-native declarative infrastructure for OCI.

## Kubernetes Cluster API Provider for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

The [Cluster API Provider for OCI (CAPOCI)][cluster_api] brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management.

The Cluster API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing for true hybrid deployments of Kubernetes.

### Features

- Manages the bootstrapping of VCNs, gateways, subnets, network security groups and instances
- Deploy either Oracle Linux or Ubuntu based instances using custom images built with the [Image Builder][image_builder_book] tool
- Deploys Kubernetes Control plane into private subnets front-ended by a public load balancer
- Provide secure and sensible defaults

### Getting Started

You can find detailed documentation as well as a getting started guide in the [Cluster API Provider for OCI Book][capoci_book].

## ðŸ¤— Community
